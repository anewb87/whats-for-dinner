What's for dinner? Perhaps not the *hardest* question of all time, but it's definitely up there. It's a question that gets asked 365-366 days a year. It wears. It grinds. It requires work. To me, "What's for dinner?" is a very hard question indeed.

Ergo, this app. This app helps users choose recipes and put together meals.

Upon opening the app, users have four recipe options to choose from: Side, Main Dish, Dessert, or Entire Meal.

Once the user has selected one of these options, they can click the *LET'S COOK* button. A random recipe from the selected category will be generated and displayed on the right side of the screen replacing the empty cook pot.

If a user does not care for that recipe or would like to select a different type of dish, they now have the option to clear the randomized recipe clicking the *CLEAR* button. This 'resets' the application, from which point the user can make a new selection.
